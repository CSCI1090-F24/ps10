# Problem Set 10

You will be doing your work in a Colab notebook. 

1. Follow [this link to the Colab notebook for PS10](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1c1W6P6XUjCzYVPcYy43GbhmcywZwCaLl?usp=sharing). Then make your own copy, as described in the notebook.
2. You will edit the Colab notebook to complete the various tasks, as indicated in the notebook.
3. You will share the notebook with me, as decribed in the notebook.
4. You will download your Colab notebook to your computer, move it into this repository, and add, commit, and push it to GitHub, just like you have done for previous problem sets.
5. You will *not* alter the Colab notebook after the deadline. If you do -- even just to fix a typo! -- it will look like you turned the notebook in late. When you put a copy in your GitHub repo, you'll ensure that the TAs will grade the right thing.
6. You will shared your `problemset10` folder on Google Drive with me and the TAs.
7. You will also download all three submission CSV files and then push them to your GitHub repo.

Don't forget that there is helpful code in [the sample code repo](https://github.com/CSCI1090-F24/sample_code/), particularly week 12 (which covers week 13, as well).


**Remember** I now expect you to write comments in your code! One point will be deducted if you do not provide comments explaining your code.

**Remember** Now at the top of every file, you will include your honor pledge. I'll give you a space in the Colab notebook for you to write your pledge.

2. Share your `problemset10` folder in your Google Drive with me.
3. Download the notebook and the submission CSVs to your computer, move them to this repository, and add, commit, and push them, just as you did for Python files in your previous problem sets.
